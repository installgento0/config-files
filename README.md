# zshrc
My ZShell setup.
# config (ncmpcpp)
**(requires mpd and beets config files to be properly set up)**

ncmpcpp is a mpd client written with ncurses. Under macOS, mpd and beets will be used for this setup.
I will probably add a regular linux config file for mpd and ncmpcpp later on.
# mpd.conf (mpd)
(MPD is used as an audio backend for ncmpcpp)
# config.yaml (beets config)
(beets is a music player daemon that implements the mpd protocol)
# Blueberry & Jam (iTerm2 theme)
