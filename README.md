# zsh config
My ZShell setup.
# ncmpcpp config
**(requires mpd and beets config files to be properly set up)**
ncmpcpp is a mpd client written with ncurses. Under macOS, mpd and beets will be used for this setup.
I will probably add a regular linux config file for mpd and ncmpcpp (eventually).
# mpd config
MPD is used as an audio backend for ncmpcpp.
# beets config
Beets is a music player daemon that implements the mpd protocol.
